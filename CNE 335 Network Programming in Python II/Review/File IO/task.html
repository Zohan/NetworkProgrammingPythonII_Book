<h1>File I/O</h1>
<p>So far, the data we have used in this book have all been either coded right into the program,
    or have been entered by the user. In real life data reside in files. For example the images we worked with in the
    image processing unit ultimately live in files on your hard drive. Web pages, and word processing documents, and
    music are other examples of data that live in files.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Write a function, <code>get_log_event_list</code> that takes 2 strings, a file_name and an event, and outputs a list
    containing the lines where the event was found:</p>
<p> 1. Create an empty list to hold the matching lines</p>
<p> 2. Open the file for reading.</p>
<p> 3. Read through all lines in the file.</p>
<p> 4. If the event string is found in the line, add it to the list.</p>
<p> 5. Outside the loop, return the list.</p>
