<h1>Lists</h1>
<p>A <strong>list</strong> is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an
index. The values that make up a list are called its <strong>elements</strong>. Lists are
similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the
elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.</p>
<p>A list within another list is said to be <strong>nested</strong> and the inner list is often called a <strong>sublist</strong>.
Finally, there is a special list that contains no elements. It is called the
empty list and is denoted <code>[]</code>.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p> 1. Write a fake_create_initial_network_list function, that creates a list with 3 IP addresses. IPs are your choice, 127.0.0.1, etc. </p>
<p> 2. Write a fake_add_to_network function, that takes a network list and an ip, and adds the new IP to the list.</p>
<p> 3. Write a get_server_at_index function, that takes a network list and an index into the list, and return the IP. Return "None" if an invalid (such as -10) or out-of-range index is provided.</p>
