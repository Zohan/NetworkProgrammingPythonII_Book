<h1>For loops</h1>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop processes each item in a list.  Each item in
turn is (re-)assigned to the loop variable, and the body of the loop is executed.
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A Domain Name Server converts site names, like google.com, to their IP address 172.217.3.174. Using a dictionary is faster than a list, because you do not need to check other elements to find the right one.</p>
<p> 1. Write a fake_create_initial_network_list function, that creates list dict with 1000 random IPs. </p>
<p> 2. Write a ip_in_network_list function, that takes a network list and an IP, and returns the IP if it was found in the last. Return "Not found" if name doesn't exist.</p>
