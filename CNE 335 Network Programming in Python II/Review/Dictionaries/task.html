<h1>Dictionaries</h1>
<p><strong>Dictionaries</strong> are a different kind of collection. They are Pythonâ€™s
built-in <strong>mapping type</strong>. A map is an unordered, associative collection.  The association, or mapping,
is from a <strong>key</strong>, which can be any immutable type,
to a <strong>value</strong>, which can be any Python data object.</p>
<p>One way to create a dictionary is to start with the empty dictionary and add
<strong>key-value pairs</strong>. The empty dictionary is denoted <code>{}</code></p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>A Domain Name Server converts site names, like google.com, to their IP address 172.217.3.174. Using a dictionary is faster than a list, because you do not need to check other elements to find the right one.</p>
<p> 1. Write a fake_create_initial_network_dict function, that creates a dict with three items, make the server name be the <strong>key</strong> (i.e. google.com), and the server ip be the <strong>value</strong> (i.e. 172.217.3.174) </p>
<p> 2. Write a fake_add_to_network function, that takes a network dictionary, a server name, and an ip, and adds the new IP to the list.</p>
<p> 3. Write a fake_dns_lookup function, that takes a network dict and a server name, and returns the IP. Return "Not found" if name doesn't exist.</p>
