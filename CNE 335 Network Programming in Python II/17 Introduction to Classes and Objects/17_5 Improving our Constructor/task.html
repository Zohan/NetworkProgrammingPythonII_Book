<h1>17.5 Improving our Constructor</h1>
<p>A function that creates a new object instance
is called a <strong>constructor</strong>.  Every class automatically uses the name of the class as the name of the constructor function.
The definition of the constructor function is done
when you write the <code>__init__</code> function.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to think of a class as a factory for making objects.
The class itself isn’t an instance of a point, but it contains the machinery
to make point instances.   Every time you call the constructor, you’re asking
the factory to make you a new object.  As the object comes off the
production line, its initialization method is executed to
get the object properly set up with its factory default settings.</p>
<p>The combined process of “make me a new object” and “get its settings initialized
to the factory default settings” is called <strong>instantiation</strong>.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Add a <code>server_name</code> variable to the <code>__init__</code> function</p>
