<h1>17.6 Adding Other Methods</h1>
<p>A <strong>method</strong> behaves like a function, but it is invoked on a specific
instance.  For example, with a server named <code>linux</code>,  <code>linux.set_server_ip('192.168.0.1')</code> asks the <code>server</code> object to perform its
<code>set_server_ip</code> method, and set the <code>server_ip</code> to 192.168.0.1.   Methods are accessed using dot notation.</p>
<p>All methods defined in a class that operate on objects of that class will have <code>self</code> as their first parameter. This serves as reference to the object itself which in turn gives access to the state data inside the object.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Add a method, get_server_ip, that returns the object's <code>server_ip</code>.</p>
