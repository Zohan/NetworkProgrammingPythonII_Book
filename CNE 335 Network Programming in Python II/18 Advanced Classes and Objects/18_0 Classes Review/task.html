<h1>18.0 Review: User Defined Classes (17.4), Adding other Methods (17.6)</h1>
<p>Every class should have a method with the special name <code>__init__</code>.
This <strong>initializer method</strong>, often referred to as the <strong>constructor</strong>, is automatically called whenever a new
instance of the object is created.  It gives the programmer the opportunity
to set up the attributes required within the new instance by giving them
their initial state values.  The <code>self</code> parameter (you could choose any
other name, but nobody ever does!) is automatically set to reference
the newly-created object that needs to be initialized.</p>
<p>The key advantage of using a class rather than something like a simple
tuple is methods.  We can add methods to any class that are sensible operations.
Creating a class brings an exceptional
amount of “organizational power” to our programs, and to our thinking.
We can group together the sensible operations, and the kinds of data
they apply to, and each instance of the class can have its own state.</p>
<p>A <strong>method</strong> behaves like a function, but it is invoked on a specific
instance. For example, with a turtle named <code>tess</code>, <code>tess.right(90)</code> asks the <code>tess</code> object to perform its
<code>right</code> method and turn 90 degrees. Methods are accessed using dot notation.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>No starter code is provided. Your tasks:</p>
<p>1. Create a class, <code>BareMetalServer</code> </p>
<p>2. Inside the class, write a constructor that takes CPU, GPU, RAM, and HDD variables and stores them </p>
<p>3. Add a method, get_system_info, that returns the system info in an array. Example: <code>[CPU, GPU, RAM, HDD]</code> </p>
