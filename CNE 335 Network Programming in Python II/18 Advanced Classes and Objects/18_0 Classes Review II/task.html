<h1>18.0 Review II: Objects as Arguments and Parameters (17.7), Instances as Return Values (17.9)</h1>

<p>You can pass an object as an argument in the usual way.  Functions and methods can return objects.  This is actually nothing new since everything in Python is an object and we have
been returning values for quite some time.  The difference here is that we want to have the method create an object using
the constructor and then return it as the value of the method.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>You will create two classes, <code>NetworkCardClass</code> and <code>NetworkServerClass</code>. </p>
<p>In NetworkCardClass:</p>
<p>1. Add constructor that stores an <code>ip_address</code> (str) and a <code>model_name</code> (str) </p>
<p>In NetworkServerClass:</p>
<p>1. Add constructor that stores an <code>ip_address</code> (str) and a <code>network_card</code> (NetworkCardClass) </p>
<p>2. Add a method, get_server_details, that returns the system info as a string. Example: <code>"Name: AWS EC2 IP: 36.63.23.21 Network Card: Intel Gigabit Adapter"</code> </p>
