<h1>19.2 Introduction to Inheritance</h1>
<p>Now, suppose we want to create a class that works like <code>ServerClass</code>
in every respect, but also keeps track of the AWS instance type.
We could create a <code>AWSServer</code> class by copying and pasting the definition for
<code>ServerClass</code>,
changing the name to <code>AWSServer</code>, and modifying the class to suit our
purposes. However, any time you copy and paste code, keep in mind that
you are copying and pasting bugs that may exist in the code. Inheritance
provides a way to reuse the definition of ServerClass without having to copy and
paste.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Create a <code>ServerClass</code> object, have <code>AWSServer</code> inherit from <code>ServerClass</code>, and then create a ServerClass object and an AWSServer object in task.py:</p>
<p>In ServerClass.py:</p>
<p> 1. Create an __init__ with ip and name variables</p>
<p>In AWSServer.py:</p>
<p> 1. Create a class that inherits from ServerClass</p>
<p> 2. Create an __init__ with ip, name, and instance_type variables
<p>In task.py:</p>
<p> 1. Import ServerClass object from ServerClass.py</p>
<p> 2. Import AWSServer object from AWSServer.py</p>
<p> 3. Create a local_server variable of ServerClass type. Initialize the variables to your choice. </p>
<p> 4. Create an aws_server variable of AWSServer type. Initialize the variables to your choice. </p>
